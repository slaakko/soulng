        Context-sensitive keywords
    </h1>

    <p>
        In some programming languages there are special identifiers that are recognized as keywords only in a specific context.
        In other contexts they behave the same as ordinary identifiers.
        For example in C# the identifiers <strong>get</strong> and <strong>set</strong> are are recognized as keywords
        only inside a property implementation and they can be used as normal identifiers in other contexts.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        SoulNG has limited support for context-sensitive keywords.
        The way it works in SoulNG is that the lexer does <em>not</em> convert identifiers to keywords in the identifier rule 
        of the lexer as it is normally done but instead the conversion is done as late as in the parser.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Example</h2>
    
    <p>
        In an XPATH query expression the identifiers <strong>child</strong>, <strong>ancestor</strong>, <strong>namespace</strong>, etc.
        can be used both as ordinary names of XML elements in a name test <em>and</em> axis specifier keywords in a step of a location path expression.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Thus the names are not converted to keywords in the
        <a href="../../reference/sngxml/xpath/html/content/file/XPathLexer.lexer_F85FAD3E06A1C893B7938541A33F4D1E1DEFEFA9.html#40">
        name</a> rule of the XPATH lexer, but the conversion is done in the

        <em>AxisName</em></a> rule of the XPATH parser.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        A similar mechanism is used for keywords <strong>and</strong> and <strong>or</strong> in the

        <em>AndExpr</em></a> and

        <em>OrExpr</em></a> rules.
