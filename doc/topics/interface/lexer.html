    <h1>
        C++ Interface of the Lexer
    </h1>

    <p>
        The interface of the lexical analyzer has two main operations: if a variable or parameter named <em>lexer</em> is of the type of the generated lexical analyzer (or reference to it),
        then the expression <strong>*lexer</strong> returns the identifier of the current token, and the expression <strong>++lexer</strong> advances the lexer to the next token.
        In addition the lexer has a member variable <strong>token</strong> that contains the matched <em>lexeme</em>, a pair of pointers to the beginning and end of the matching characters.
    </p>

    <p>
        As it moves forward in the stream of tokens, the lexer will save the scanned non-separator tokens.
        They will have indeces starting from zero. The <em>GetPos()</em> member function of the lexer will return the position,
        or index, of the current token, and the <em>SetPos()</em> member function will set the lexer to the given position in the token stream,
        so that the <strong>*lexer</strong> operation will return the identifier of the token in that position. In this way the parser can backtrack to a previous position and rescan
        tokens from that position onward again. The <em>GetToken()</em> member function of the lexer will return a token in the given position.
    </p>

    <p>
        A <em>span</em> is a range of token indeces. The <em>GetSpan()</em> member function of the lexer will return a span that has the current token index as its start and end index.
        By setting start and/or end indeces of a span, and then calling the <em>GetMatch()</em> member function of the lexer with that span,
        the lexer will return a string that contains all matching characters including separators for that span of tokens.
    </p>
