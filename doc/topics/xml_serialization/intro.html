	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	
	<p>
		SoulNG contains support for serializing class objects as XML. 
		The XML serialization support is based on a C++ source-to-source tool called <strong>xmlsergen</strong> and a
		C++20 <strong>serialization</strong> library.
		The xmlsergen tool takes an <a href="syntax.html">XML serialization description file</a>, <em>.xmlser</em> file, 
		as input and generates C++ header and source files that contain C++ classes to be serialized.
		Each class provides <strong>ToXml</strong> and <strong>FromXml</strong> member functions that write the
		member variables of the class to XML elements, and read data from XML elements to the member variables 
		respectively.
