    <h1>
        Introduction
    </h1>

    <p>
        The <em>SoulNG</em> project contains two C++ tools: a lexical analyzer generator <strong>slg</strong> and a parser generator <strong>spg</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
        The generators and the produced lexical analyzers and parsers use four libraries also included in the project:
        The <strong>soulng/cppcode</strong> library is used for representing C++ code in the generators.
        The <strong>soulng/lexer</strong> library contains a base class for generated lexical analyzer classes.
        The <strong>soulng/parser</strong> library contains two small classes needed in parsing.
        The <strong>soulng/util</strong> library contains common utilities,
        utilities for manipulating Unicode strings and an interface to a Unicode character database also included in the project.
        The Unicode character database is a binary file located in the <strong>unicode</strong> subdirectrory.
    </p>

    <p>
        The tools and libraries of the <em>SoulNG</em> project are implemented and tested using Microsoft Visual Studio Community Edition 2017 for Windows using x64 configuration,
        with <a href="http://boost.org">Boost</a> version 1.68 libraries installed. Visual Studio C++ compiler is needed for utilizing these tools and libraries on Windows.
        Tools and libraries are tested also on WSL using
        the GNU C++ compiler, g++ version 7.4.0, and the <a href="https://www.boost.org/">Boost</a> version 1.65.1 libraries installed.
        A C++ compiler and Boost libraries are needed for utilizing these tools and libraries on Linux / on WSL.
    </p>

    <h2>Lexical Analyzer Generator</h2>

    <p>
        The <strong>slg</strong> tool takes a <em>.lexer</em> file that contains the description of a lexical analyzer as input and
        produces C++ source code for a lexical analyzer as output. The lexical analyzer will tokenize an input string passed to it as a UTF-32 encoded string.
        The input string may contain the content of a UTF-8 encoded text file, for example. The <strong>util</strong> library provides functions for
        reading a text file into a string and converting that string to a UTF-32 string.
    </p>

    <p>
        The description of the lexical analyzer in a <em>.lexer</em> file is presented as token declarations,
        regular expression patterns and semantic actions, C++ statements, that connect the patterns and tokens.
        The lexical analyzer generated by <strong>slg</strong> is a finite state machine that recognizes
        the patterns and returns the corresponding tokens to the parser.
    </p>

    <h2>Parser Generator</h2>

    <p>
        The <strong>spg</strong> tool takes an <em>.spg</em> file, a container file that references a number of <em>.parser</em> files,
        and those <em>.parser</em> files that contain descriptions of parsers as input and produces C++ source code for parser classes as output.
        The parser classes will use a lexical analyzer generated with <strong>slg</strong> to do the tokenization of the input content.
        The parsers contain no state. They are C++ classes that consist of static member functions that call each other recursively.
        The parser classes form together a recursive descent top-down backracking parser.
    </p>

    <h2>Examples</h2>

    <p>
        Two examples are included in the project.
        The <strong>examples/minilang</strong> directory contains a Visual Studio project that enclose
        a lexical analyzer and a parser for a very small C-like language called <em>Minilang</em>. The tutorials included in this documentation
        guide through the development of the lexical analyzer and the parser for <em>Minilang</em> in stages.
        The <strong>examples/cmajor</strong> directory contains a working lexical analyzer
        and parser for the <a href="https://slaakko.github.io/cmajor/">Cmajor</a> programming language.
        As of this writing, the parser included in the Cmajor <em>compiler</em> is still not yet implemented using <em>SoulNG</em>.
