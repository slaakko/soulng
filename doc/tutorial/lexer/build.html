    <h1>
        2.2 Building the Lexer
    </h1>

    <p>
        These instructions are for the Microsoft Visual Studio Community Edition, and for the x64 configuration.
    </p>

    <h2>
        Generating the Lexer
    </h2>

    <p>
        The example code is in the <strong>examples/minilang</strong> directory.
        We have created a C++ console application project with name <strong>minilang</strong> to the <strong>examples/minilang</strong> directory and
        put the <em>Minilang.lexer</em> that contains the lexer defined in the previous stage to the <strong>examples/minilang</strong> directory and included it in the project.
    </p>

    <p>
        Now open a command prompt in the <strong>examples/minilang</strong> directory and execute the following command:
    </p>

    <pre>
        slg -v Minilang.lexer
    </pre>

    <p>
        The SoulNG lexer generator <strong>slg</strong> reads a <em>Minilang.lexer</em> file.
        If the generator detects no errors, it generates a lexical analyzer for the definitions in the <em>.lexer</em> file as C++ code:
    </p>

    <pre>
        C:\soulng-1.0.0\examples\minilang>slg -v Minilang.lexer
        > C:/soulng-1.0.0/examples/minilang/Minilang.lexer
        ==> C:/soulng-1.0.0/examples/minilang/MinilangTokens.hpp
        ==> C:/soulng-1.0.0/examples/minilang/MinilangTokens.cpp
        ==> C:/soulng-1.0.0/examples/minilang/MinilangKeywords.hpp
        ==> C:/soulng-1.0.0/examples/minilang/MinilangKeywords.cpp
        ==> C:/soulng-1.0.0/examples/minilang/ClassMap.hpp
        ==> C:/soulng-1.0.0/examples/minilang/ClassMap.cpp
        ==> C:/soulng-1.0.0/examples/minilang/MinilangLexer.hpp
        ==> C:/soulng-1.0.0/examples/minilang/MinilangLexer.cpp
    </pre>

    <p>
        By giving the <em>-v</em> option, you can instruct the generator to print the paths of the input and output files as it reads and generates them.
        If the <em>-v</em> option is not given, the generator prints nothing if the <em>.lexer</em> definition contains no errors.
    </p>

    <p>
        The <strong>slg</strong> tool creates C++ header and source files with the file names corresponding to the identifiers defined
        for the <em>tokens</em>, <em>keywords</em> and <em>lexer</em> declarations in the <em>.lexer file</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
        The tool also generates files <strong>ClassMap.cpp</strong> and <strong>ClassMap.hpp</strong> that will contain a Unicode character class map for the lexer.
    </p>

    <p>
        If a project contains many lexers, each must have a unique class map. A unique class map can be created with a
        <a href="../../topics/syntax/lexer.html#class-map-declaration">class map declaration</a> in a <em>.lexer</em> file.
    </p>

    <p>
        Add the generated source and header files to the <strong>minilang</strong> project.
    </p>

    <h2>
        Compiler Settings for the Lexer Project
    </h2>

    <p>
        The generated lexer uses the <strong>soulng/lexer</strong> and <strong>soulng/util</strong> libraries that in turn depend on the <a href="https://boost.org">Boost</a> C++ libraries,
        so we must set the include and linker directories of the <storng>minilang</storng> project to have it compile.
    </p>

    <h3>
        Setting the INCLUDE path of the <strong>minilang</strong> project
    </h3>

    <p>
        Add a path to the <strong>soulng-1.0.0</strong> root directory to the <em>C/C++ / General / Additional Include Directories</em>.
        Also add a path to the <a href="https://boost.org">Boost</a> directory to Additional Include Directories. We have boost version 1.68 installed under
        the <strong>C:\Program Files\boost</strong> directory so we add <strong>C:\Program Files\boost\include\boost-1_68</strong> to the include path.
        Finally add the ".." path to the include path, so we can include headers under the <strong>minilang</strong> directory in the project.
    </p>

    <h3>Linker Settings</h3>

    <p>
        Add a path to the <strong>soulng-1.0.0/lib</strong> directory to the <em>Linker / General / Additional Library Directories</em>.
        Also add a path to the Boost library directory. We have installed the boost libraries to the <strong>C:\Program Files\boost\lib</strong> directory.
        Finally add "$OutDir" to the library path, so we link all libraries defined in the current solution. We have currently no other libraries in this solution.
    </p>

    <p>
        The SoulNG libraries have <strong>#pragma comment(lib, "&lt;library>.lib")</strong> declarations in the header files, so they are automatically added to the linked libraries.
    </p>

    <h2>
        Main
    </h2>

    <p>
        Because we are building a program it must have a <strong>main</strong> function defined somewhere. Add a source file <strong>Main.cpp</strong> with the following content
        to the project:
    </p>

    <pre>
        #include &lt;iostream>

        int main(int argc, const char** argv)
        {
            return 0;
        }
    </pre>

    <h2>
        Compiling the Lexer Project
    </h2>

    <p>
        Now the <strong>minilang</strong> project should compile without errors. Some warnings are generated that can be turned off by setting the <em>C/C++ Advanced / Disable Specific Warnings</em>
        value to <strong>4251;4244</strong>.
